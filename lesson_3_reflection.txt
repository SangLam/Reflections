When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When you wish to collaborate with others or to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling automatically from remote might cause conflict with files that you have
	been working on locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork makes a clone of a repository into your collection of repository on GitHob. 
	Clone makes a direct copy of a repository from GitHub to local, or local to local.
	Branches is a special collection of commits with each commit having a parent in the 
	collection.
	You would use fork to make a copy on Github's server, clone to make a copy to a 
	local directory, and branch to separate different aspect of the same project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
