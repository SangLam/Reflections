What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, it is just an empty shell for you to 
	start tracking files in. You need to add files for it to know what to 
	track.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an area in which we can previow the commit we are
	about to make. It differs from the repository since nothing is set in 
	stone yet and no commit comment was given. It differs from the working 
	directory as some files have a temporary updated status.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
	This area allows you to preview the changes that a commet will make.
